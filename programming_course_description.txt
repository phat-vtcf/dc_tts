1. In this course, you will learn how to program in Python for voice technology. 
2. Similar to other scientific settings, in voice technology, the code should be written so that it not only achieves the purpose for which it is designed, 
3. but also has replicable results and can be appropriately reused. 
4. Replicable and reusable code leads to replications and reuse, which lead to citations and impact.
5. Therefore, this course mostly teaches you to efficiently and effectively write code suitable for replication and reuse of experiments. 
6. This means your code should be easily understood by peer researchers.
7. You will also learn to adjust your code in response to reviews and be encouraged to appropriately reuse code of others.
